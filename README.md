# ooo-user

Welcome to the past. This is some user management code built on top of even more ancient
[samskivert] user management code that was/is used in a bunch of [Three Rings] games.

It's still actually used by operating games (now run by [Grey Havens] who are looking after said
games into their senescence) which is why it's out here on Github so that we can ship releases of
it to Maven Central and whatnot.

The library itself is your standard "maintain a user database" kind of blah blah. Nothing exciting
and certainly nothing that should be used for new projects.

So unless you're some kind of archaeologist, you probably want to move it along.
